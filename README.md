codeafterhours - beta
==============

Project based on ideas from Code 4 Puerto Rico.
For now its just for sending a message to my email from the people that are interested in the project.
The site is live at beta.ens-labs.com. 

By the way, its really a mess for now, at least until I finish school(About 1 week).


**This is an old projet, please refer to the new one: https://github.com/inaki/codeafterhours/tree/Daniel-experimental**
